This python script takes a plaintext file and captures:
- the number of words and the count of each letter in the text file, and
- prints a report of this data to the console.

The path to the file to process is hardcoded in the script.
To process a different file with this script, you need to edit the `filename` variable and supply the correct file path--I recommend using absolule paths.
